3. Arrange different stations around the stage or venue. Our optimal design looks like the following image.

4. Connect the stations to the PSU.

5. Unpack the fixtures with a RED label.

6. Place the fixtures in the desired stations inserting them with the screw covered in masking tape towards the power cable.
   
7. All fixtures (regardless of if they have a fixture plugged in or not) will show up as a device on the OLA screen, the guide on the back of the main controller unit will say what each station is patched to, stations have a total of 4 patch addresses, depending on the type of fixture it will vary how you patch them, the most generic patch is 3 channels (RGB) more rarely will there be 4 (CMYK) or IRGBS (not applicable for this type of fixture).



Fixtures are already patched when plugged in, you can use any DMX or ArtNet/sACN enabled device with this system.
