# Lighting Board
The FunEventSystems lighting board is designed to be as intuitive to use as possible and is designed for small theatre productions, like middle school drama plays.


## Setting up
### Unpacking
- Open the flight case which contains the lighting board.
- Take out the board, power supply, and PC connection cable.

### Powering on
- Connect the power supply cable to either a 5V wall adapter or a battery bank.
- Connect the opposite end of the cable into the lighting boards power receiver cable.
- Connect the PC to the board using the connection cable. The board will show up as COM device when connected successfully.

### Setting up
- The software is very basic to use, and requires minimal setup, just connecting it and typing in the OLA universe number and IP will connect it, you can then patch it like a normal console to individual DMX channels.
## Software

The software is currently Windows only, with little plans to change it, it may also be compatable with newer versions of MacOS, though minimal testing has been done to confirm this. The drivers are not bundled, though it should prompt you to install the COM drivers when the device is first connected, then install Python, and run the script after changing the variables, it will show up with a UI showing the information. This will have it's own page when the software is finalized, in early February.

## Useful information
- Ensure all cables are plugged in, the correct way.
